I am a 4th-year computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto and a graduate student researcher at the [Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research](https://tdccbr.med.utoronto.ca/) and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). I previously interned at [Ai2](https://ai2-web.apps.allenai.org/) on the [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/about) team. My work centres on natural language processing (NLP) for science, and particularly biomedicine. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Ottawa, graduating magna cum laude with a B.Sc in biochemistry. I completed my Masters degree in computer science at the University of Toronto.
