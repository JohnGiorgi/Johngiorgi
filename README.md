### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 2nd-year computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto and a graduate student at the [Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research](https://tdccbr.med.utoronto.ca/) and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). My work centres on information extraction and natural language processing (NLP) from/on biomedical literature. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Ottawa, graduating magna cum laude with a B.Sc in biochemistry. I completed my Mastersâ€™s degree in computer science at the University of Toronto.
